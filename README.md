# MarverGalaxy2-AndroidGame

The goal of the project is to develop a simple mobile application similar to Oliver Kocsis' Match Up gameplay as an obligation of Year 2, Computer Science, in adherence to the subject Application Development. It involves laying all cards face down on a surface initially. During each turn, two cards are flipped face up. The objective is to find pairs of matching cards by flipping them over. The game continues until all pairs have been matched, indicating the end of the game. 

Concept Overview

The game immerses players into the vast and rich universe of Marvel Comics, bringing together beloved characters from the franchise across the galaxy. Players engage in classic match-up mechanics where they flip cards to reveal pairs of characters from the Marvel universe. If they so choose, the difficulty may increase, requiring sharper memory and quicker reflexes. Each card features a unique comic portrait of a Marvel character, adding a nostalgic and collectible aspect to the game. Players aim to uncover and collect all the character cards as they progress through the round.
 
The game's icon displays a similarity to the iconic Marvel logo, signalling its affiliation with the beloved comic book universe. The title “Marvel Galaxy” evokes a sense of cosmic adventure and exploration. The home page sets the tone with a mesmerising galaxy background adorned with a shooting meteor and the iconic Marvel infinity stones, capturing the grandeur and scale of the Marvel cosmos. With comic portraits of characters adorning the front of the cards, and Avengers logo on the back of the cards, the game exudes a nostalgic charm, appealing to fans of classic Marvel comics while offering a fresh and interactive way to engage with their favourite characters.
